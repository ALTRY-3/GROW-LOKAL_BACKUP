## 💎 Key Highlights

### ✅ Working Features (Tell Users About)
- Authentication (email, Google, Facebook)
- Browse 6 product categories (48 products)
- Shopping cart & checkout
- Card payments (PayMongo test mode)
- Order tracking with unique IDs

### ❌ Missing Features (Be Honest About)
- Search (UI exists, not functional)
- Cart dropdown (shows fake items)
- Profile pages (not created)
- Order history list (no page)
- GCash payments (not implemented)
- Product reviews (static demo data)
- Stories/Events/Map (not created)
- Notifications (UI only)

### 🎯 Most Important Info

**Test Cards (Always Have Ready):**
```
✅ Success: 4343 4343 4343 4345 | 12/2025 | 123
❌ Declined: 5100 0000 0000 0198 | 12/2025 | 123
❌ Declined: 4400 0000 0000 0016 | 12/2025 | 123
```

**Common Issues:**
- "Search doesn't work" → It's in development, browse by category
- "Cart shows wrong items" → Click "Go to Cart" for real items
- "Can't find order history" → Use direct order link
- "Payment failed" → Check if using decline test card
- "No GCash option" → GCash coming soon, use cards

  "order history": "Access orders via direct link. Save your order ID.",
  "profile": "Profile editing coming soon.",
  // ... more from CHATBOT_QUICK_PROMPT.md
};

function respond(query) {
  for (let [key, answer] of Object.entries(faq)) {
    if (query.toLowerCase().includes(key)) {
      return answer;
    }
  }
  return "Let me connect you with a human agent!";
