# Security Fix: Generic Login Error Messages

## ✅ What Changed

Fixed security vulnerability where login error messages revealed too much information to potential attackers.

---

## 🔒 Before (INSECURE)

```
❌ Invalid credentials. 4 attempts remaining before account lockout.
❌ Invalid credentials. 3 attempts remaining before account lockout.
❌ Invalid credentials. 2 attempts remaining before account lockout.
❌ Invalid credentials. 1 attempt remaining before account lockout.
❌ Account locked due to 5 failed login attempts. Please try again in 30 minutes.
```

**Problems:**
- Reveals account exists
- Shows exact attempt counter
- Helps attackers optimize brute force attacks
- Enables account enumeration

---

## ✅ After (SECURE)

```
✅ Invalid email or password. Please try again.
✅ Invalid email or password. Please try again.
✅ Invalid email or password. Please try again.
✅ Invalid email or password. Please try again.
✅ Too many failed login attempts. Your account has been temporarily locked for security. Please try again in 30 minutes.
```

**Benefits:**
- Generic error message (same for all attempts)
- No attempt counter revealed
- No account enumeration possible
- Only shows lockout when actually locked

---

## 🎯 Security Benefits

1. **Account Enumeration Prevention**
   - Attacker can't tell if account exists or not
   - Same error for existing/non-existing accounts

2. **Brute Force Protection**
   - No attempt counter for attackers to track
   - Must guess blindly without feedback
   - More likely to trigger lockout

3. **Information Disclosure Minimized**
   - Only reveal lockout when it happens
   - Use relative time (minutes) not absolute time
   - Don't confirm account details
