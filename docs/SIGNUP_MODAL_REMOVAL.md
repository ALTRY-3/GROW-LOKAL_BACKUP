# Signup Success Modal Removal

## Changes Made

Successfully removed the success modal popup that appeared after signup completion.

### Modified File:
- `src/app/signup/page.tsx`

### Changes:

1. **Removed State Variable**
   - Removed `showSuccessModal` state that controlled modal visibility

2. **Updated Success Behavior**
   - Changed from showing a modal to displaying an inline success message
   - Added automatic redirect to login page after 2 seconds
   - Success message: "Account created successfully! Please check your email to verify your account."

3. **Removed Modal JSX**
   - Removed the entire success modal component including:
     - Modal overlay
     - Success icon and title
     - Email verification instructions
     - Gmail/Outlook quick links
     - Development mode verification link display
     - Resend verification email button
     - "Go to Login" button

## New Flow After Signup:

1. User clicks "SIGNUP" button
2. Form is validated and submitted
3. On success:
   - Green success message appears at the top of the form
   - Message says: "Account created successfully! Please check your email to verify your account."
   - After 2 seconds, user is automatically redirected to `/login`
4. Development link (if any) is still logged to console for testing

## Benefits:

- **Cleaner UX**: No modal popup interrupting the flow
- **Faster**: Automatic redirect reduces user friction
- **Simpler**: Inline success message is less intrusive
- **Still Informative**: Success message clearly tells user to check email

## Testing:

1. Go to http://localhost:3001/signup
2. Fill out the signup form
3. Click "SIGNUP"
4. You should see:
   - A green success message appear at top of form
   - Automatic redirect to login page after 2 seconds
   - No modal popup

## Development Mode:

The development verification link is still available in the browser console for testing purposes. Check the console log for:
```
Development verification link: http://localhost:3001/verify-email?token=...
```
