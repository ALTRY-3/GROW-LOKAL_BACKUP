# Payment Page Issue - Diagnosis & Fix

## Your Issue

**Problem:** "Why upon checkout it redirect me to card and no option for card payment details"

**Translation:** After clicking "Place Order" at checkout, you're redirected to `/payment/ORDER-ID` but the **card input fields don't appear** on the page.

---

## Root Causes (3 Possible Issues)

### Issue #1: JavaScript Error (Most Likely)
The payment page loads, but there's a JavaScript error preventing the form from showing.

**Symptoms:**
- Page redirects correctly to `/payment/ORD-xxxxx`
- Page shows header/navbar
- But card input fields are missing
- Pay button might be disabled or show "Initializing..."

**How to Check:**
1. Open browser DevTools (press F12)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Reload the payment page
4. Look for red error messages

**Common Errors You Might See:**
```
❌ Failed to fetch order
❌ 403 Unauthorized access to order
❌ 404 Order not found  
❌ Network error
❌ Cannot read properties of null/undefined
```

---

### Issue #2: Order Authorization Error
The API blocks you from viewing the order because of user session mismatch.

**Fixed in latest update!** ✅

The code has been updated to allow guest checkout access.

---

### Issue #3: Payment Intent Creation Fails
The payment page loads the order but fails to create a payment intent with PayMongo.

**Your Setup:**
- ✅ PayMongo keys ARE configured in `.env.local`
- ✅ Keys are in correct format (`sk_test_...`)
- ✅ Server detected `.env.local` file

**Possible Causes:**
- PayMongo API is down (rare)
- Network connectivity issue
- API keys are invalid/expired
- Rate limiting

## How to Diagnose

### Step 1: Check Browser Console
```
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/marketplace
2. Add item to cart → Checkout → Place Order
3. When payment page loads, press F12
4. Click Console tab
5. Look for errors (red text)
```

**What to look for:**
- "Failed to fetch order" → Order API problem
- "Unauthorized" → Session problem (should be fixed now)
- "Failed to create payment intent" → PayMongo API problem
- "Network error" → MongoDB or server connectivity

### Step 2: Check Network Tab
```
1. Press F12 → Network tab
2. Reload payment page
3. Look for these requests:
```

**Expected requests:**
```
✅ GET /api/orders/ORD-20251002-0003 → Status: 200
✅ POST /api/payment/create-intent → Status: 200
```

**If you see:**
```
❌ GET /api/orders/ORD-xxx → Status: 403
   Problem: Authorization error (should be fixed now)

❌ GET /api/orders/ORD-xxx → Status: 404
   Problem: Order doesn't exist in database

❌ POST /api/payment/create-intent → Status: 500
   Problem: PayMongo API error (check terminal)

❌ No GET request to /api/orders/ORD-xxx
   Problem: JavaScript error preventing API call
```

### Step 3: Check Terminal Output
Look at your PowerShell terminal where `npm run dev` is running.

**You should see:**
```
GET /payment/ORD-20251002-0003 200 in 2000ms
GET /api/orders/ORD-20251002-0003 200 in 500ms
POST /api/payment/create-intent 200 in 1000ms
```

**If you see:**
```
GET /payment/ORD-20251002-0003 200 in 2000ms
Warning: PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY is not set
```
→ Environment variables not loaded (restart server)

```
GET /api/orders/ORD-20251002-0003 403 in 100ms
```
→ Authorization error (fixed in latest code)

### Step 4: Check MongoDB
```powershell
# Open MongoDB shell
mongosh

# Use database
use grow-lokal

# Check if order exists
db.orders.find({ orderId: "ORD-20251002-0003" }).pretty()

# Should return order data
# If returns nothing → order wasn't created
```

---

## Solutions

### Solution A: Restart Development Server
Environment variables only load on server start!

```powershell
# Stop server: Press Ctrl+C in terminal
# Start again:
cd d:\GrowLokalCopy\grow-lokal
npm run dev
```

**Then test again:**
1. Go to marketplace
2. Add to cart
3. Checkout
4. Place order
5. Check if form appears

### Solution B: Clear Browser Cache
Old JavaScript might be cached.

```
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Chrome/Edge)
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Click "Clear data"
4. Reload payment page
```

Or force reload: `Ctrl+Shift+R`

### Solution C: Test with Browser Console Open
This helps catch errors:

```
1. Press F12 BEFORE going to checkout
2. Keep DevTools open
3. Go through checkout process
4. Watch Console for errors
5. Report any errors you see
```

### Solution D: Use COD Instead (Temporary Workaround)
If you just want to test the order flow:

```
1. At checkout, select "Cash on Delivery"
2. Place order
3. You'll skip payment page
4. Go directly to order details
```

This confirms checkout → order creation works!

## Quick Test Checklist

```
 [ ] MongoDB is running
 [ ] Dev server is running (npm run dev)
 [ ] .env.local file exists with PayMongo keys
 [ ] Server was restarted after adding .env.local
 [ ] Browser cache was cleared
 [ ] Can successfully create an order (checkout works)

## Next Steps

**I've updated 2 files:**
1. `src/app/payment/[orderId]/page.tsx` - Better error handling
2. `src/app/api/orders/[id]/route.ts` - Fixed authorization for guest checkout

**You need to:**
1. **Restart your dev server** (Ctrl+C, then `npm run dev`)
2. **Test again** with browser console open (F12)
3. **Report any errors** you see in console

**The payment form SHOULD now appear!** ✅

If it still doesn't work, share your browser console errors and I'll help debug further.
