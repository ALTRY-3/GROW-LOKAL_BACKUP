## Quick Implementation Example

### For a ChatGPT-based Bot:

```javascript
// System prompt
const systemPrompt = `
${CHATBOT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md content}
`;

// API call
const response = await openai.createChatCompletion({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: systemPrompt },
    { role: "user", content: userMessage }
  ],
  temperature: 0.7,
  max_tokens: 500
});
```

### For a Simple FAQ Bot:

```javascript
const faqMap = {
  "search": "Search is in development. Browse the 6 categories by scrolling through the marketplace page.",
  "order history": "Visit your order using the order ID link from checkout. Full order history page coming soon!",
  "profile": "Profile editing is in development. Use 'Forgot Password' to reset password.",
  // ... more from CHATBOT_QUICK_PROMPT.md
};

function getResponse(userQuery) {
  const lowercaseQuery = userQuery.toLowerCase();
  
  for (let [keyword, response] of Object.entries(faqMap)) {
    if (lowercaseQuery.includes(keyword)) {
      return response;
    }
  }
  
  return "I'm not sure about that. Would you like to speak with a human agent?";
}
```
