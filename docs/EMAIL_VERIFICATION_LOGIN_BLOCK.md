# Email Verification Login Block Implementation

## Overview
Added email verification requirement for user login. Users with `emailVerified: false` in MongoDB cannot log in until they verify their email address.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Authentication Logic
**File**: `src/lib/auth.ts`

**Added Email Verification Check:**
```typescript
// Check if email is verified
if (!user.emailVerified) {
  throw new Error('EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED');
}
```

**Location**: In the `CredentialsProvider` authorize function, after password validation and before successful login.

**Flow:**
1. User enters email and password
2. System validates credentials
3. **NEW:** System checks if `emailVerified === true`
4. If not verified, login is blocked with error message
5. If verified, login proceeds normally

### 2. Added Friendly Error Message
**File**: `src/lib/authErrors.ts`

**Added Error Message:**
```typescript
'EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED': 'Please verify your email address before logging in. Check your inbox for the verification link.',
```

This message is displayed to users when they try to login without verifying their email.

## How It Works

### User Experience Flow:

#### For Unverified Users:
1. User signs up → Account created with `emailVerified: false`
2. User receives verification email
3. User tries to login before verifying
4. ❌ **Login is blocked**
5. Error message displayed: "Please verify your email address before logging in. Check your inbox for the verification link."
6. User clicks verification link in email
7. `emailVerified` set to `true` in MongoDB
8. User can now login successfully ✅

#### For Verified Users:
1. User signs up
2. User clicks verification link
3. `emailVerified: true` in MongoDB
4. User can login immediately ✅

### OAuth Users (Google/Facebook):
- OAuth users are automatically verified
- `emailVerified: true` is set during OAuth signup
- They can login immediately without email verification

## Database Field

### User Model Field:
```typescript
{
  emailVerified: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false
  }
}
```

**States:**
- `false` (default) - User cannot login until verified
- `true` - User can login normally

## Security Benefits

1. **Prevents Fake Signups**: Ensures valid email addresses
2. **Account Ownership**: Confirms user owns the email
3. **Reduces Spam**: Blocks bot accounts without valid emails
4. **Security Layer**: Additional verification step before access

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Unverified User Login
```
1. Create account at /signup
2. DON'T click verification email
3. Try to login at /login
4. Expected: Login blocked with verification message
5. Check console: "EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED" error
```

### Test Case 2: Verified User Login
```
1. Create account at /signup
2. Click verification link in email
3. Try to login at /login
4. Expected: Login successful, redirected to /marketplace
```

### Test Case 3: OAuth User Login
```
1. Login with Google/Facebook
2. Expected: Login successful immediately (no verification needed)
3. Check MongoDB: emailVerified should be true
```

### MongoDB Query to Check:
```javascript
// Find unverified users
db.users.find({ emailVerified: false })

// Find verified users
db.users.find({ emailVerified: true })

// Manually verify a user (for testing)
db.users.updateOne(
  { email: "test@example.com" },
  { $set: { emailVerified: true } }
)
```

## Error Handling

### Error Display Locations:
- Login page: Error message appears at top of form
- Console: Full error details logged
- User sees: "Please verify your email address before logging in. Check your inbox for the verification link."

### Error Message Variations:
All these error codes map to the same friendly message:
- `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED`
- `AccountNotVerified`
- Any error containing "verify" or "verification"

## Integration Points

### Where Verification Check Happens:
1. **Login Flow** - `src/lib/auth.ts` (CredentialsProvider)
2. **Error Display** - `src/app/login/page.tsx` (uses getFriendlyErrorMessage)
3. **Verification Action** - `src/app/api/auth/verify-email/route.ts` (sets emailVerified to true)

### Related Components:
- `src/components/ResendVerification.tsx` - Resend verification email
- `src/app/verify-email/page.tsx` - Verification landing page
- `src/lib/email.ts` - Send verification emails

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (if needed):
```bash
# Already configured
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
EMAIL_FROM=your-email@gmail.com
```

### No Additional Setup Required:
- Uses existing email verification system
- No new environment variables needed
- Works with current MongoDB schema

## Bypass Options (Development Only)

### Option 1: Manual Database Update
```javascript
// In MongoDB Compass or shell
db.users.updateOne(
  { email: "dev@example.com" },
  { $set: { emailVerified: true } }
)
```

### Option 2: Development Link
- When `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_DEV_LINKS=true`
- Verification link appears in console after signup
- Click link to verify immediately

### Option 3: Skip Verification (Not Recommended)
To temporarily disable verification check for development:
```typescript
// In src/lib/auth.ts (REMOVE AFTER TESTING)
// Comment out these lines:
// if (!user.emailVerified) {
//   throw new Error('EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED');
// }
```

## Production Considerations

### Email Delivery:
- Ensure email service is configured
- Check spam folders for verification emails
- Monitor email delivery rates

### User Support:
- Provide "Resend verification" button on login page
- Allow users to request new verification email
- Show helpful error message with next steps

### Monitoring:
- Track verification rates
- Monitor blocked login attempts
- Alert on high unverified user rates

## User Communication

### Signup Page:
- Shows success message after registration
- Tells user to check email for verification link
- Redirects to login after 2 seconds

### Login Page:
- Shows verification error clearly
- Provides "Resend verification email" option
- Links back to signup if needed

### Verification Email:
- Clear call-to-action button
- Explains why verification is needed
- Link expires after 1 hour (can be configured)

## Related Documentation

- `docs/SESSION_UX_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Resend verification feature
- `docs/SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Overall security features
- Email verification API documentation

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/lib/auth.ts` - Added emailVerified check
2. ✅ `src/lib/authErrors.ts` - Added EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED error message

## Benefits

✅ **Security**: Only verified email addresses can access the system
✅ **User Experience**: Clear error message with actionable steps
✅ **Spam Prevention**: Blocks fake/bot accounts
✅ **Account Safety**: Confirms user owns the email address
✅ **Existing Integration**: Works with current verification system

## Summary

Users with `emailVerified: false` in MongoDB are now blocked from logging in. They receive a clear error message prompting them to verify their email address. This adds an important security layer while maintaining a good user experience with helpful error messages and resend options.
