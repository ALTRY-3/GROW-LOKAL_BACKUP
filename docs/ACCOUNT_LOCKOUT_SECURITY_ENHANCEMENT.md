# Account Lockout Security Enhancement

## üîí Security Improvement: Generic Error Messages

### Problem
The previous error messages were too detailed and could help attackers:

**Before (INSECURE):**
```
‚ùå Invalid credentials. 4 attempts remaining before account lockout.
‚ùå Invalid credentials. 1 attempt remaining before account lockout.
‚ùå Account locked due to 5 failed login attempts. Please try again in 30 minutes.
```

**Security Issues:**
1. **Account Enumeration**: Reveals that the account exists
2. **Attempt Counting**: Tells attacker exactly how many attempts remain
3. **Information Disclosure**: Confirms lockout mechanism details
4. **Brute Force Aid**: Attacker knows exactly when to stop/switch accounts

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Generic Error Messages

### After (SECURE)
```
‚úÖ Invalid email or password. Please try again.
‚úÖ Invalid email or password. Please try again.
‚úÖ Too many failed login attempts. Your account has been temporarily locked for security. Please try again in 30 minutes.
```

**Security Benefits:**
1. **No Account Enumeration**: Same message whether account exists or not
2. **No Attempt Counting**: Attacker doesn't know how many attempts remain
3. **Less Information**: Only reveals lockout when actually locked
4. **Better Security**: Forces attackers to guess blindly

---

## üìã Changes Made

### 1. Failed Login Message (Before Lockout)

**Before:**
```typescript
message: `Invalid credentials. ${attemptsRemaining} attempt${attemptsRemaining !== 1 ? 's' : ''} remaining before account lockout.`
```

**After:**
```typescript
message: `Invalid email or password. Please try again.`
```

**Impact:**
- ‚ùå Removed: Remaining attempts counter
- ‚ùå Removed: Lockout warning
- ‚úÖ Added: Generic error message
- ‚úÖ Added: No account existence confirmation

### 2. Account Locked Message

**Before:**
```typescript
message: `Account locked due to ${MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS} failed login attempts. Please try again in ${LOCKOUT_DURATION_MINUTES} minutes.`
```

**After:**
```typescript
message: `Too many failed login attempts. Your account has been temporarily locked for security. Please try again in ${LOCKOUT_DURATION_MINUTES} minutes.`
```

**Impact:**
- ‚ùå Removed: Exact number of failed attempts
- ‚ùå Removed: "Account locked due to X attempts" (confirms account exists)
- ‚úÖ Added: Generic security message
- ‚úÖ Kept: Lockout duration (necessary for user to know when they can retry)

### 3. Active Lockout Check Message

**Before:**
```typescript
message: `Account is locked due to too many failed login attempts. Please try again after ${user.accountLockedUntil.toLocaleTimeString()}.`
```

**After:**
```typescript
const minutesRemaining = Math.ceil((user.accountLockedUntil.getTime() - now.getTime()) / (1000 * 60));
message: `Too many failed login attempts. Please try again in ${minutesRemaining} minute${minutesRemaining !== 1 ? 's' : ''}.`
```

**Impact:**
- ‚ùå Removed: Exact time (could be used for timing attacks)
- ‚úÖ Added: Relative minutes remaining (more user-friendly)
- ‚úÖ Added: Generic message

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. **Prevent Account Enumeration**
```typescript
// Same error message for both scenarios:
- Account doesn't exist ‚Üí "Invalid email or password"
- Account exists but wrong password ‚Üí "Invalid email or password"
```

### 2. **No Attempt Counter**
```typescript
// Attacker can't count attempts:
- Attempt 1: "Invalid email or password"
- Attempt 2: "Invalid email or password"
- Attempt 3: "Invalid email or password"
- Attempt 4: "Invalid email or password"
- Attempt 5: "Too many failed attempts..." (Only reveals on actual lockout)
```

### 3. **Minimal Information Disclosure**
```typescript
// Only reveal lockout when it actually happens
if (isLocked) {
  return "Too many failed login attempts. Please try again in X minutes."
} else {
  return "Invalid email or password. Please try again."
}
```

### 4. **Time-Based Lockout Info**
```typescript
// Show relative time instead of absolute time
const minutesRemaining = Math.ceil(timeRemaining / 60000);
return `Please try again in ${minutesRemaining} minutes`;
// Instead of: "Please try again after 2:45:30 PM"
```

## üîç Attack Scenarios Prevented

### Scenario 1: Account Enumeration
**Before (Vulnerable):**
```
Attacker tries: test@example.com
Response: "Invalid credentials. 4 attempts remaining"
‚Üí Account EXISTS (confirmed)

Attacker tries: random@example.com
Response: "Invalid credentials"
‚Üí Account DOESN'T EXIST (can enumerate valid emails)
```

**After (Protected):**
```
Attacker tries: test@example.com
Response: "Invalid email or password. Please try again."

Attacker tries: random@example.com
Response: "Invalid email or password. Please try again."
‚Üí Can't tell if account exists or not
```

### Scenario 2: Brute Force Optimization
**Before (Vulnerable):**
```
Attacker knows:
- Exactly how many attempts remain
- Can stop at 1 attempt remaining
- Can switch to different account
- Can time attacks perfectly
```

**After (Protected):**
```
Attacker doesn't know:
- How many attempts are remaining
- When lockout will trigger
- Must guess blindly
- More likely to trigger lockout
```

### Scenario 3: Timing Attacks
**Before (Vulnerable):**
```
"Please try again after 2:45:30 PM"
‚Üí Attacker knows exact server time
‚Üí Can correlate with other timing info
```

**After (Protected):**
```
"Please try again in 28 minutes"
‚Üí Relative time only
‚Üí No server time disclosure
```

## üìä Impact Assessment

### User Experience
- ‚úÖ **Minimal Impact**: Users still get clear feedback
- ‚úÖ **Helpful Messages**: "Invalid email or password" is clear
- ‚úÖ **Lockout Info**: Users know how long to wait
- ‚úÖ **No Confusion**: Messages are still user-friendly

### Security Posture
- ‚úÖ **Account Enumeration**: PREVENTED
- ‚úÖ **Brute Force**: HARDER (no attempt counter)
- ‚úÖ **Information Disclosure**: MINIMIZED
- ‚úÖ **Timing Attacks**: MITIGATED

### Attacker Difficulty
- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **Account Discovery**: Much harder
- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **Brute Force Success**: Lower probability
- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **Attack Efficiency**: Significantly reduced
- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **Time Required**: Dramatically increased

## üîß Configuration

### Current Settings
```typescript
const MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS = 5;        // Attempts before lockout
const LOCKOUT_DURATION_MINUTES = 30;  // How long account is locked
const RESET_ATTEMPTS_AFTER_MINUTES = 60; // Reset counter after inactivity
```

### Recommended Settings (Production)
```typescript
const MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS = 5;        // Standard (not revealed to user)
const LOCKOUT_DURATION_MINUTES = 30;  // Revealed on lockout
const RESET_ATTEMPTS_AFTER_MINUTES = 60; // Internal only
```

| Already locked | "Account locked...try after 2:45 PM" | "Try again in 25 minutes" | Time remaining |
| Account doesn't exist | "Invalid credentials" | "Invalid email or password" | None |
