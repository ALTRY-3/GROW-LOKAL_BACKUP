## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
// User session
const { data: session, status } = useSession();
const { items, fetchCart, clearCart } = useCartStore();

// Local state
const [checkoutItems, setCheckoutItems] = useState<CheckoutItem[]>([]);
const [userAddress, setUserAddress] = useState<UserAddress | null>(null);
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
const [isProcessing, setIsProcessing] = useState(false);
const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

### Data Flow
1. **Page Load** → Load selected items from sessionStorage or cart
2. **Fetch User** → Get user profile and address from API
3. **Display Data** → Show items, address, totals
4. **User Selects Payment** → Enable place order button
5. **Place Order** → Validate, create order via API, clear cart
6. **Success** → Show modal, redirect to orders or payment page

### API Integration
- **GET /api/user/profile** - Fetch user details and address
- **POST /api/orders** - Create new order with items and address
- **Cart Store** - `fetchCart()`, `clearCart()` for cart management

## 📦 Order Data Structure

```typescript
{
  items: [
    {
      productId: string,
